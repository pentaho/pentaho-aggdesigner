Provides an Aggregate Designer utility to design an optimal set of pre-computed
summary tables for a star schema.

<p>The summary tables, known as aggregates, allow applications such
    as the Mondrian OLAP engine to access the star schema efficiently.</p>

<p>Also, some databases allow you to declare summary tables as first-class
    objects in DDL; the system will maintain the aggregate tables, and the
    query optimizer will automatically use them to satisfy a query whenever
    possible. Teradata Aggregate Join Indexes (AJIs), Oracle Materialized
    Views, and IBM DB2 Materialized Query Tables are examples of this.</p>
