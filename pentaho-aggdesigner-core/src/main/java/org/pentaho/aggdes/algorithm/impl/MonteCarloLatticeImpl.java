     * Returns the probability that an arbitrary query uses a given aggregate.

     * that all queries with 0 bits are equally likely, all queries with 1 bits
     * are equally likely, and so forth. In general, there are {@code C(n, k)}
     * queries with {@code k} bits. Therefore the weight of a given query with
     * {@code k} bits is {@code C(n, k) / (n + 1)}.
     *
     * <p>(The query model is somewhat arbitrary. It tries to express the
     * fact that a given query on fewer attributes happens more often a given
     * query with many attributes. The model does not yet recognize that
     * attributes in hierarchies tend to be accessed together, or that certain
     * attributes (e.g. those in the time dimension) are accessed more often
     * than others.)
     *
     * <p>We need to generate the list of queries that would benefit from this
     * aggregate, and compute how many rows are saved for each query. Let's
     * suppose initially that there are no aggregates that are more specific.
     * If the aggregate has {@code b} bits, then there is 1 query with
     * {@code b} bits that can be satisfied (the one that matches the aggregate
     * precisely), (n - b) queries with {@code b + 1} bits, and in
     * general C(n - b, n - r) queries with r bits (b &le; r &le; n);
     * and {@code 2 ^ (n - b)} queries in total.
     *
     * <p>The weights of the queries depend on the level, and the total number
     * of queries in the level. For the level with r bits (b &le; r &le; n),
     * the total number of queries is C(n, r), while the number of queries
     * that can be satisfied by this aggregate is C(b, r - b).
     *
     * <p>For example, suppose n = 10, b = 3 (i.e. the aggregate has 3 out of
     * 10 bits set). There are C(10, 3) = 120 queries at level 3, and only one
     * of them (C(3, 0) = 1) has 3 bits, namely the query that is a direct hit
     * for the aggregate. At level 2 there are C(10, 2) = 45 queries of which
     * C(3, 1) = 3 can use the aggregate.
     *
     * <table>
     * <tr><th>Level</th><th>Total queries</th><th>Satisfiable</th><th>Weight</th></tr>
     * <tr><td>0</td>    <td>C(10, 0)= 1</td><td>C(3, 0) = 1</td><td>1 / 1</td>
     * <tr><td>1</td>    <td>C(10, 1)= 10</td><td>C(3, 1) = 3</td><td>3 / 10</td>
     * <tr><td>2</td>    <td>C(10, 2)= 45</td><td>C(3, 2) = 3</td><td>3 / 45</td>
     * <tr><td>3</td>    <td>C(10, 3)= 120</td><td>C(3, 3) = 1</td><td>1 / 120</td>
     * <tr><td>4 .. 10</td>    <td>C(10, r)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
     * </table>
     *
     * <p>Add up all of the level weights and divide by (n + 1) = 11, to get a
     * total weight of 0.1188. 12% of expected queries will use this aggregate.
     *
     * <p>Now let's look at what happens if there are aggregates that are
     * more specific than this one. The queries that use these aggregates will
     * continue to use these aggregates, and thus will not benefit from this
     * aggregate. We therefore subtract the weight of all queries that
     * use these more specific aggregates from the benefit.
