Defines the interface of the Aggregate Designer algorithm and supporting classes.

<p>The Aggregate Designer consists of a number of components:
<ul>
<li>The <dfn>schema loader</dfn> component
    ({@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.SchemaLoader}) reads a star schema and presents
    the algorithm with a {@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Schema} object and
    embedded {@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Table}
    and {@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Attribute} objects.</li>

<li>The <dfn>algorithm</dfn> component
    ({@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Algorithm}) tries to find the
    most efficient set of aggregates for a given schema. A set of aggregates
    is efficient if it enables any expected query to evaluate quickly yet
    has a reasonable cost in terms of disk space and load time.</li>

<li>The <dfn>result handler</dfn> component
    ({@link org.pentaho.aggdes.output.ResultHandler}) converts the result of
    the algorithm into a useful form such as a script of CREATE TABLE
    statements to create aggregate tables and INSERT statements to populate
    them. A result handler is not necessary if you are invoking the algorithm
    programmatically and your program will process the
    ({@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Result})object produced by the
    algorithm itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the components is specified a particular Java interface that extends
    {@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Component}. There is a default
    implementation for each component, but you can provide your own.</p>

<p>There is a command-line utility {@link org.pentaho.aggdes.algorithm.Main}
    to allow you to invoke the algorithm. You can choose which implementation
    of each component, and provide parameters to each component.</p>
